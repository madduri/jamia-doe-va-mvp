# JAMIA Paper on HPC Architectures enabling Precision Medicine - A Case Study on Collaboration with DOE and VA 

Inspired by [a LaTeX template][amia] for the same reasons, this repository
contains a Markdown template for article submission for Journal of the American
Medical Informatics Association (JAMIA).

This template is intended to create a PDF article using a Markdown file and
compiled using `pandoc`.

## Features

This project attempts to make it easy to:

- add figures with captions and reference figures in text
- inject LaTeX if additional formatting is necessary
